Properties file
1.Right click on the name of the project
2.New -> File
3.Enter name: configuration.properties
4.OK
properties file works like a control center, we manage our browser, urls,
database and couple of user information from those file and it changes values evertwhere that we used configuration input.
It has key and value structure.
Single Responsibility principle(this class only do one job)
