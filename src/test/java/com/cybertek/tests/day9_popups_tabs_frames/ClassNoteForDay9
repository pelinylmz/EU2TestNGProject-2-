DROPDOWNS
dropdown menu is a menu that offers a list of options.Most of the time we only allowed to choose one.

select--> html tag
SELECT class --> class from selenium

SELECT class only works with the webelement which has select tag.
How to use SELECT class
1.make sure the dropdown has select tag.
2.locate the dropdown just like any other element
3.create object using Select class by passing the lement that we locate step 2 as a constractor

getOptions()--> returns all the available optiosn from the dropdown list.

getFirstSelectedOption()--> returns webelement, first selected option

HOW TO SELECT OPTION FROM DROPDOWN LIST
1.Using Visible Text
selectByVisibleText("text") --> selecting based on the visible text of options

2.Using index number
selectByIndex(indexNumber)-->select based on index of options(starts from 0 )

3.Using value attribute
selectByValue(option value) -->select based on value of value attribute

NO SELECT DROPDOWN

When we try to use Select class with the dropdown which does not have select tag, we got
UnexpectedTagNameException: Element should have been "select" but was "a"

If we dont have select tag, we locate dropwdown just like any other elements and to see options with clicking or hovering over to it.

To get all options from dropdown, we can use common locator between them(exp: classname,tagname etc) then we can use List methods to get the size and expected option from the list.

we use click() method to click different options., we can either locate the option seperately or use index of the option form the list.
=========================
Popups,alerts,Iframes,Windows
================================
Popups,alerts,modal,dialog,overlay --> anything pop ups on the webpage.
How to handle pop ups
we have 2 different way of handling pop ups, based on their structure.
1.HTML POP UPS
if the pop up is from html, we deal with it as if it is another web element.
2.JAVASCRIPT ALERTS
second types of pop up came from javascript, mostly known as js alerts. We CANNOT right lcick on those alers and see html(Inspect)
To deal with non html alerts, we have special class from selenium which is Alert

how to point the alert ?
Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

and we have accept, dismiss, sendkeys,gettext method for alerts.

If there is no alert on the webpage, and we try to switch, we get NoAlertPresentException: no such alert
================================
Tab and Windows
In selenium there is no difference between tabs and windows.By default selenium controls one html page.When we open the page first time it points that page only. When we open a new tab/window, it will still be looking at the old window. To do any interaction with the new window we have to switch to new window.

driver.getWindowHandle(); --> this returns some unique code belongs the windows that we open with driver.get()

handle--> unique identifier for windows
driver.getWindowHandle() --> returns the handle of the current windows

driver.getWindowHandles()--> returns the set of the all open windows.


HOW TO HANDLE MORE THEN 2 WINDOWS/TABS in SELENIUM
If you have more then 2 windows, we need some unique identifier for us like title, url etc. Then based on our identifier we will keep switching windows until we find our expected window.
================================
Frames
NoSuchElementException
1.locator might be wrong(dynamic or not correct)
2.not enough wait time
3.iframe or frame

In html we can have one html page inside to another. This is made possible by tag <iframe> or <frame>. using frames we can put html inside html. when we have page with frames, selenium cannot control what is inside the frame. we have to switch iframe first.
When we switch to iframe it will not see the default page, until we switched back.


-we can only switch one at a time, cannot switch to grandchild directly.
-cannot switch to siblings, only parent to child

HTML (defaultContent) --> first html
frame-top (parentFrame) --> one level up
0 left
1 middle
2 right
frame-bottom
