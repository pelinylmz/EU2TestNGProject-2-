10-1 new class hours for next month sunday included
================
Waits
Thread.sleep
ImplicitWait
ExplicitWait
Thread.sleep

    This method is from java, not selenium. It pauses the program based on given milisecond.

    It waits for the duration given, be careful not to use too long or to little.

    It is recommended to minimize the use of thread.sleep using too much slows the execution of tests.

                                    -IMPLICITLY WAIT-
    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    this is a wait come from selenium

    1.Amount of time
    2.Unit of time (seconds,miliseconds,days etc)

    HOW FIND ELEMENTS METHODS WORKS?
    we provide locator and try to find element to do some actions using findELements method
        If element FOUND,
             it will return WebElement
        IF element does NOT FOUND
                a.it will check do we have implicitly wait set ?
                    -it will keep trying to find element up to time we set.
                        1.if it finds within the time, it will return the webelement
                        2.if it cannot find UP TO time we set, it will throw NoSuchElementException
                b.if there is no implicitly wait set, it will throw NoSuchElementException
    This waits for elements to be found in HTML. It only works when we call findElement method.
    Implicitly wait only waits until the element is located.
    Implicitly wait is set once, then it is used by rest of the program.
    If we have many findElements methods, they will all use the same implicitlyWait.
    *** As long as findElement method find the webelement on the html, it does NOT care is it interactible, visibible, clickible or not.
    it will return the element. So implicitly wait will not solve our elementNotInteractible problems.
    IF ELEMENT IN THE HTML, findElement WILL NOT COMPLAIN.
=====================================
-EXPLICITLY WAIT-
Sometimes we might locate the element but we cannot interact with it within certain time.
we have to wait until it is visible, clickible, enabled, has certains text or disapper etc.
when we have to wait for these cases, we will use Explicit wait.
2 step to use explicit wait, first create the object and pass parameters
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,20) 20 --> in seconds
WebDriverWait --> class used to explicit waits
it takes 2 paramters driver, time in seconds
use object to wait until specific conditions for specific weblement or case.
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(inputBox));
ExpectedConditions-->contains conditions for wait that we can wait using WebdriverWait
Depending on what condition we are using, we can pass webelement, by locator or text to the ExpectedCoditions.
Explicit wait waits for the condition to complete, once the condition is met, it will stop waiting(dynamic).
if the condition is not met and the time runs out we got TimeoutExeption
COMPARSION OF 3 WAITS
THREAD.SLEEP
call every time you need
wait for whole duraion, not dynamic
not selenium wait
IMPLICIT WAIT
call it once,(set for driver)
waits while trying to find element
waits until element found or time runs out(dynamic)
EXPLICIT WAIT
call every time you need
wait until condition is met or time runs out(dynamic)
waits for different conditions(interactible,visible,invisilbe,text,clickible etc)
