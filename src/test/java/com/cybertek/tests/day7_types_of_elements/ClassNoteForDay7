=============================
TestNG
Developers write their code and do Unit testing. Inn unit testing smallest block of code is tested.

Java: TestNG and Junit
C#: Nunit
phyton: pytest

TestNG allows us to run, organize tests, it can do assertions and verification, generate reports.

Install TestNG

1.go to mvnrepo
2.get testNG dependency
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
<version>7.1.0</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

@Test--> this is an annotation, it means the method after this @Test is TestNG test method. we can run testNg test methods.

We can have multiple @Test s in one class,
IF we wanat to run specific test, right click to test name and run or click run botton next to it.

To run all the tests inside the one class, right click run button next to class name or click empty space inside the class and run.

@BeforeMethod -->runs once before each method with @Test annotations
@AfterMethod --> runs once after each method with @Test annotations

How to ignore some @Test to run ?
@Ignore --> we can put on top of the @Test that we want to ignore
OR
we can comment out the @Test annotation

@BeforeClass --> runs only once before everything in the class
@AfterClass --> runs only once after everything in the class

<BeforeClass>
<BeforeMethod>test1<AfterMethod>
<BeforeMethod>test2<AfterMethod>
<BeforeMethod>test3<AfterMethod>
<AfterClass>
======================================
Assertions

Assert --> this is the class in testing, it has methods used to do assertions like when we compare values

in testing, if assertion fails, rest of the method will NOT execute, it will be ignored/skipped.

If we still want to run rest of the code even if assertion fail,we will use soft assertions.It will execute the rest (not learning today)

if you code fail in test1,it will NOT effect other @Test s, they will run seperately.

NOTE:Whetever your test case fail or not , your before and after method will executed always.So even if your code fails, you can quit from your driver.

Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected)-->it checks two value same or not

Assert.assertTrue(condition) --> it checks whetever condition return true or not

Assert.assertFalse(condition) --> it checks whetever condition return false or not

Assert.assertNotEquals(actual,expected) -->verifies that two values are NOT equal to each other

we can add message all of our assertions to see what we are checking

Assert.assertTrue(condition,message)
Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected,message)
==================================
Radio buttons

Radio buttons is a type of elements in which only one option can be selected among group of options (Example:Gender - Male,Female,Other)

Based on the requirements you might or might not have default option selected.

//how to check radio button selected or not ?
isSelected()--> if radio buttons selected it will return true, if not it will return false.

//how to select radio button ?
we can use click() method for selecting radio buttons too.

//how can we check if the button is enabled ?
isEnabled() --> method that returns true if the button enabled, if not it reutns false

When we try to interact with disabled elements 2 things can happen:
1.no action will be happen and code will not fail, not complain
2.no action will be happen but we can get ElementNotInteractableException: element not interactable
